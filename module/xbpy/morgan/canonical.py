"""Canonical atom ordering built as a ladder of tie-breakers.

Every rung of the ladder is consulted only for the atoms or fragments that the
rungs above it left tied, and all rungs that are invariant under rotation and
translation come before the ones that are not.  Note that interatomic distances
are invariant under reflection as well, so a distance-only ladder is E(3)- and
not SE(3)-complete; the signed volume rung is what removes the reflection.

Fragments (connected components) are ordered by

1. fragment chemistry -- size plus the Weisfeiler-Lehman refinement of the atom
   chemistry, so graph topology and element/bond identity.  Elements are led by
   their periodic group rather than their atomic number, which keeps a
   substituent at the same index across the group,
2. the distances to the *other* fragments, visited in the order of the fragment
   classes that are already distinguishable from the tied group and iterated to
   a fixed point, so that a group whose members only become separable after some
   other group has been split is still resolved,
3. signed volumes of the fragment centroids against a canonical frame,
4. the distance of the fragment to the coordinate origin -- SE(3)-dependent.

Atoms inside a fragment follow the same principle

1. atom chemistry refined by Weisfeiler-Lehman relaxation,
2. intra-fragment distance geometry, again with the tied class visited last,
3. inter-fragment distance geometry,
4. signed volumes against a frame built from the fragment itself, which is what
   separates atoms related by a mirror image but not by any rotation,
5. signed volumes against a frame anchored on the partners of the complex, which
   is what separates the two sides of a planar ring,
6. the position in an internal frame, and only in the laboratory frame when no
   internal frame exists -- the SE(3)-dependent rung.

The last rung is reached only for a group whose members some proper symmetry of
the structure exchanges.  For such a group no ordering exists that is invariant
under rigid motion, because an isometry that maps the structure onto itself while
swapping two atoms forces every invariant descriptor to agree on them.  What does
stay fixed is which indices the group occupies, not which of its members takes
which index.

``decimals`` controls the tolerance at which two distances count as equal.  Ties
that survive even the coordinates are broken by the input atom index, which
guarantees that the result is always a permutation; this can only happen for
atoms that share a position.

Distances are only ever computed from the atoms or fragments that are still tied,
so a molecule whose chemistry already separates everything costs nothing beyond
the refinement, and a large structure only pays for its symmetric groups.  A
tied group big enough that its distances would exceed ``max_distance_cells``
skips the invariant geometry and drops to the placement rung instead, which
keeps the ordering usable on systems with hundreds of thousands of atoms at the
price of a coarser tie-break.
